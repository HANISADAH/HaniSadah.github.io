        <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
        <p>I started my coding journey on June 13, 2025, with absolutely no background in HTML or CSS. Everything was completely new to me, and I didn’t know where to begin. But in just two weeks, I’ve already learned the basics of HTML and CSS — how to structure a webpage, add text, create links, and style everything with fonts and colors. It’s been exciting to see what I can build from scratch. Learning to code has made me even more curious and motivated. I’m really enjoying it so far and can’t wait to dive into the next lessons.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges I faced was understanding how CSS works with HTML. It took me a few tries to get used to selectors and the cascade rules. But practicing with small projects helped a lot!</p>
